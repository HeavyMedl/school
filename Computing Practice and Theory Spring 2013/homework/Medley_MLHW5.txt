1. Fill in the rest of the table for computing the variance for a binomial distribution with p = 0.8 and n = 2.

Xi	| P(x) | XiP(Xi)| Xi - u| (Xi - u)^2
0	| 0.04 | 0	| -1.6	| 2.56
1	| 0.32 | 0.32	| -1.28	| 1.63
2	| 0.64 | 1.28	| 0.4	| 0.16

u = 1.6

2. Find a 90% confidence interval for a normal random variable with sample average = 20 and sample standard deviation = 10, and N = 25. Show your work.

Mean	20
SD	10
n	25
DF	n - 1 = 24
T	1.71

Confidence Interval = mean - sem, mean + sem
s = (t * (sd / sqrt(n)))
s = (1.711 * (10 / sqrt(25)))
Confidence Interval = (16.578, 23.422)

3. Referring to Figure 6.8b on P. 221, there are six leaf nodes. For the third leaf node, numbering from the left, write a rule that would capture exactly the instances in that leaf node. 

If windy = true and humidity = high then play = yes

4. Explain what a normakized list of attributes is and why normalization is important.

Attributes that are divided into smaller subsets by relationships defined on them.  Normalization ensures data scales with each subset, etc.

5. Give a distance metric between two instances each with 5 binary attributes: a1, .. a5.

sqrt[(a1-a1)^2 + .. + (a5 - a5)^2]
