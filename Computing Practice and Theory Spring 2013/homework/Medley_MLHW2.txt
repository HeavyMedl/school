1. The confidence coefficient is the number by which the model will prune a tree by removing a leaf.  Changing the confidence factor to a higher degree forces the model into be more specific before classifying a certain instance.  This may effect the decision points based on the training data set.

2.  Ross Quinlan's ID3 takes the average information value of each potential vertex of a tree and calculates the information gained; which it designates as a value.  It then takes the node with the largest information value gain to form the root of the tree.  It then iteratively applys the same algorithm to each successive tree vertex.

3. Iris-versicolor.  After determining the 5 nearest neighbors: 3 are classified as versicolor and 2 are classified as virginica.

	4.7 - 1.6 - Iris-versicolor
	4.8 - 1.8 - Iris-versicolor
	4.8 - 1.8 - Iris-viriginica
	4.8 - 1.8 - Iris-viriginica
	4.7 - 1.8 - Iris-versicolor

4. 

	If (petal length >= 2.45 and petal length < 4.45 and petal width >= 1) then Iris Versicolor
	If (petal length >= 2.45 and petal length < 4.45 and petal width < 1) then Iris Setosa
	If (petal length >= 4.45 and petal width >= 1.7) then Iris Virginica
	If (petal length >= 4.45 and petal width < 1.7) then Iris Versicolor

5.

	A. 15
	B. (50! / 45!) ^ 3
	C. Every fold seems to produce the same result.  Changing the seed will produce a differnt fold of data.
	D. Folds 10 - Seed: 0

	a b c <-- classified as
	3 2 0 | a = Iris-setosa
	1 2 2 | b = Iris-versicolor
	0 0 5 | c = Iris-virginica

	Folds 10 - Seed: 1
	
	a b c <-- classified as
	4 1 0 | a = Iris-setosa
	0 3 2 | b = Iris-versicolor
	0 0 5 | c = Iris-virginica
